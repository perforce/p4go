# P4Go - A P4API derived API

P4Go is a wrapper for the P4 C++ API in Go.

P4Go is a Go module that provides an API to P4 Server. Using P4Go is faster than using the command-line interface in scripts, because multiple command can be executed on a single connection, and because it returns P4 Server responses as Go structs.


## Requirements

Go 1.24

The P4API relevant to your platform:
* Linux x86_64 - http://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r25.1/bin.linux26x86_64/p4api-glibc2.12-openssl3.tgz
* Linux aarch64 - http://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r25.1/bin.linux26aarch64/p4api-openssl3.tgz
* MacOS - https://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r25.1/bin.macosx12u/p4api-openssl3.tgz
* Windows - https://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r25.1/bin.mingw64x64/p4api-openssl3_gcc8_win32_seh.zip

OpenSSL 3
* On Linux, this is typically the libssl-dev package
* On MacOS/Windows you'll need prebuilt platform specific binaries

## Build flags

* Linux
```sh
go env -w CGO_CPPFLAGS="-I<absolute path to Perforce C++ API>/include -g"
go env -w CGO_LDFLAGS="-L<absolute path to Perforce C++ API>/lib -lp4api -lssl -lcrypto"
```

* MacOS
```sh
go env -w CGO_CPPFLAGS="-I<absolute path to Perforce C++ API>/include -g"
go env -w CGO_LDFLAGS="-L<absolute path to Perforce C++ API>/lib -L<absolute path to OpenSSL libraries matching Perforce C++ API> -lp4api -lssl -lcrypto -framework ApplicationServices -framework Foundation -framework Security"
```

* Windows
```sh
go env -w CGO_ENABLED=1
go env -w CGO_CPPFLAGS="-I<absolute path to Perforce C++ API>/include -DOS_NT -g"
go env -w CGO_LDFLAGS="-L<absolute path to Perforce C++ API>/lib -L<absolute path to OpenSSL libraries matching Perforce C++ API> -lp4api -lssl -lcrypto -lcrypt32 -lws2_32  -lole32 -lshell32 -luser32 -ladvapi32 -lole32 -pthread -v"
```
